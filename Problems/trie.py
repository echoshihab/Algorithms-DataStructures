"""
A trie (pronounced as "try") or prefix tree is a tree data structure used to efficiently 
store and retrieve keys in a dataset of strings. There are various applications of this data structure, 
such as autocomplete and spellchecker.

Implement the Trie class:

- Trie() Initializes the trie object.
- void insert(String word) Inserts the string word into the trie.
- boolean search(String word) Returns true if the string word is in the trie (i.e., was inserted before), and false otherwise.
- boolean startsWith(String prefix) Returns true if there is a previously inserted string word that has the prefix prefix, and false otherwise.

# obj = Trie()
# obj.insert(word)
# param_2 = obj.search(word)
# param_3 = obj.startsWith(prefix)
