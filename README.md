# Binary Search
Find a randomly selected number in a list using iterative and recursive binary search and compare to linear search

# Selection sort
1) Use selection sort to modify the original list
2) Use selection sort to return a new sorted list

# Quick Sort
1) Use pivot of first index
2) use pivot of median of three
